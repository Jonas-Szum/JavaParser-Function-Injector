# JavaParser-Function-Injector
Written in a Codio environment, this program reads class files and injects a "toString" method if they don't already have one.

Given a decent amount of starting code for this project, I was tasked with writing "toStringGenerator.java", "Runtime.java", part of "Main.java", "StaticFieldInfo.java", and "RuntimeInfo.java". Those raw files have been included in a separate folder if you would like to read over them. Otherwise, copy the contents of this repository into a codio environment to test it out yourself!
